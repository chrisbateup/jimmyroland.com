      <description>ALL ideas on this page where engineered, developed, user experience designed, deployed, and managed by me alone. Nin.Codes This idea was a solution to a problem Nintendo gave to its loyal fans. The Nintendo platform does not have traditional user names and instead use a 12 digit unique code you must share to connect with friends. My web app allows users to create a custom short link they can give to their friends that easily displays their 12 digit Nintendo Friend Code.</description>

      <description>More information about me and what I do to come!
Jimmy My education came from DeVry University with a BS in Gaming and Simulation Programming. This experience focused on understanding real-time rendering and really helped me grasp the concepts of optimized coding practices. My motivation comes from my desire to never stop learning. Every day I dabble in topics from cars to cooking to technology to finance. Everyday is an opportunity to improve your own self-worth.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From depression to fit. I learned how making myself better physically and mentally could help propel my wellbeing. Also, stop following low carb diets and learn how to eat like a human!&lt;/p&gt;
