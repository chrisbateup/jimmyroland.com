## Static Websites
This service is for people who want a website that is primarily used for displaying information. You can discuss the type of products or service you are selling but not sell them directly from the site.

The software used to create websites has a number of different themes that are [available to view as demos](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and can be customized to fit your needs. Before any work is started, pick a theme and let me know any customizations that you would like me to make.

Do to the nature of a static website, updates are done manually by me and will be completed in a timely manner but not instantly.

Make subdomains (subdomain.example.com) that point to your other profiles and get traffic data using the popular Google Analytics.
