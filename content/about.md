More information about me and what I do to come!

## Jimmy
My education came from DeVry University with a BS in Gaming and Simulation Programming. This experience focused on understanding real-time rendering and really helped me grasp the concepts of optimized coding practices. My motivation comes from my desire to never stop learning. Every day I dabble in topics from cars to cooking to technology to finance. Everyday is an opportunity to improve your own self-worth. Having more knowledge gives you the ability to help others along the way which is uplifting.
